ðŸš§ This project is under construction ðŸš§ 

One more package to support env tags to load environment variables on structs. It is more about studying Go reflection approach than to create something that already exists.

Better test output with:
```shell
go install github.com/rakyll/gotest
```

Requirements:
* Go >= 1.17

Inspired by 
* https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig/blob/master/envconfig.go
